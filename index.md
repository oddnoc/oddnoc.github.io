I am [Chief Engineer][1] at [Quinn Interactive, Inc.][2], a San Francisco web development and design firm.

I earned my Ph.D. in the Management of Information Systems and Cognitive Psychology at the Claremont Graduate University. I taught a graduate level class, “Principles of Usability,” at the Academy of Art in San Francisco, and was a Lecturer and Assistant Professor in the Communication Design department at California State University, Chico for 8 years, teaching web development and human factors.

I make sure our team can solve complex problems in [Silverstripe][3], and have contributed to the Silverstripe [framework][4] and related projects. I’m always trying to make hard things easy and impossible things possible.
